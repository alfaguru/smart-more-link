# Smart read more link
Drupal module that provides a dynamic read more link for body text.

It acts like the core Summary or Trimmed Text formatter, except that when its output is not the full body it adds a read more link. This makes it possible for the site builder to create a teaser style which only shows "Read more" when there is more to read.

This formatter is only suited to simple content types which have a single long text field. It's more of an proof of concept than a fully fledged module at the moment.
